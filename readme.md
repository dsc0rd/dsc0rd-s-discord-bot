# JDA-based discord bot

Just something I was making around 5 years ago and only recently found laying around. I really liked the system of in-chat command construction that supported running javascript which allows for more intricate functionalities to be added, while admittedly not that simple to use. I was still learning things at the time and had my frustrations, so the code is definitely not the best.

I'm not planning to maintain it. This code is free to use, no license required, but do feel free to mention me.

Should work out of the box, but if it does not - please let me know, I'll try and fix it. 


`config.json` stores all the configuration data, ~~duh~~.
`commands.json` file has some command examples. You can change the used file in the config, though.
Token needs to be provided in .env file as DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN.
